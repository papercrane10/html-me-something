                <ul>


                    <li>Rule 1: Goblin kind can only hunt in the shadow of the moon. They cannot hunt while in moonlight. This means, if your target enters the moon light, you cannot hurt it in anyway.</li>
                    <li> Rule 2: The happiness of comradorie can only be completed in the light of the moon. To achieve comradorie you must exchange a meal with another being in the moonlight. When completed, those comrads will be blessed with moonlight and
                        follow you for fun the rest of the night. </li>
                    <li>Rule 3: There are no rules for how to get treasure.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div>
                <p>To please the Goblin King, goblin kind must follow these rules or else, you'll be forced to cheer on others as a follower. Followers are encouraged to cheer on fellow goblins. If you're lucky, the king may allow you to re-enter the games.
                    </br>
                    For each rule followed, goblins will be rewarded for their engagement based on when the treasure is gathered.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="section-header">Rewards</h2>
            <div id='goblinlist'>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 point for each treasure collect.</li>
                    <li>2 points for each hunt completed</li>
                    <li>3 points for each comrade collected</li>
                    <li>5 points for each hunt collected with a comrade</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The goblins with the highest points will get blessed by our Great King.</p>

                <h1 class="section-header">Dungeon Master Notes</h1>
                <p>This game was created to be played as a one-shot. This can occur in any setting with any evil creature. It does not have to be goblins. The map can be known so you don't have to do any fog of war stuff. You should, however, keep the enemies/encounters
                    unknown. The way I was imagining it was having the encounters as question marks on the board. Each question mark would have the encounter determined when reached. How you determine that is up to you. <br> I did not give too much thought
                    into this as other things. <strong>This has never been playtested since its creation in April 2019</strong></p>
