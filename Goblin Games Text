Rule 1: 
Goblin Kind can only hunt in the shadow of the moon. They cannot hunt while in moonlight. This means, if your target enters the moon light, you cannot hurt it in anyway.

Rule 3:
There are no rules for how to get treasure. 

To please the Goblin King, goblin kind must follow these rules or else, you'll be forced to cheer on others as a follower. Followers are encouraged to cheer on fellow goblins. If you're lucky, the king may allow you to re-enter the games. 

For each rule followed, goblins will be rewarded for thier engagement based on when the treasure is gathered. 

1 point for each treasure collect. 
2 points for each hunt completed
3 points for each comrade collected
5 points for each hunt collected with a comrade

The goblins with the highest points will get blessed by our Great King. 

Happy Goblin Games!
